# Tuition Management System - Backend Implementation Walkthrough

I have implemented the backend structure for the Tuition Management System, including Entities, Repositories, Services, and REST Controllers.

## Key Features
- **Entities**: Created [Student](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Student.java#6-22), [Attendance](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Attendance.java#7-21), [Report](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Report.java#7-26), [ReportMarks](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/ReportMarks.java#6-39), and [Fees](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Fees.java#7-24) in the `modal` package.
- **Auto-Calculation**: Added logic in [ReportMarks](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/ReportMarks.java#6-39) to automatically calculate [Percentage](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/ReportMarks.java#19-38) and [Grade](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/ReportMarks.java#19-38) when data is saved or updated.
- **REST APIs**: exposing CRUD endpoints for all entities.
- **Project Structure**: Followed the existing package naming conventions (`modal`, `repo`, `service`, `controller`).

## Components Implemented

### 1. Entities (`com.safwan.tutionmanagement.modal`)
- **[Student.java](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Student.java)**: Contains student details including class and group.
- **[Attendance.java](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Attendance.java)**: Tracks student attendance.
- **[Report.java](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Report.java)**: Stores report metadata (Year, Month).
- **[ReportMarks.java](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/ReportMarks.java)**: Stores subject marks with automatic grade logic.
- **[Fees.java](file:///d:/safwan-learning/SpringBoot_TutionMS/tutionmanagement/src/main/java/com/safwan/tutionmanagement/modal/Fees.java)**: Manages fee records.

### 2. Services & Repositories
- Created Service classes in `com.safwan.tutionmanagement.service` to handle business logic.
- Created Repository interfaces in `com.safwan.tutionmanagement.repo` extending `JpaRepository`.

### 3. Controllers (`com.safwan.tutionmanagement.controller`)
- Exposes endpoints like `/student/add`, `/student/all`, `/fees/add`, etc.
- Enabled `CrossOrigin("*")` for easy frontend integration.

## Usage Example
To add a student, send a POST request to `/student/add` with the JSON body:
```json
{
    "stdName": "Safwan",
    "fatherName": "Father",
    "phoneNo": "123456",
    "className": "10",
    "groupName": "Science",
    "classesPerWeek": 5,
    "paymentOption": "Advance"
}
```

To add marks (which auto-calculates grade):
```json
{
    "subjectName": "Math",
    "maxMarks": 100,
    "totalMarks": 95
}
```
Result will include `"percentage": 95.0` and `"grade": "A+"`.
